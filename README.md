# react-to-do
## This is a React Version of the [to-do list](https://github.com/NammanShukla/todo-list) published before ! 

At first, It seemed simple enough to import files from the previous project into react but this framework does not play nice... atleast for a beginner. I has to redo the stucture, spliting the former project into components, filter, header, status bar and task manager. Lastly ofcourse I had to adjust the CSS. 


Making 1 major change and 1 minor QOL change; With the update feature, it would open up a dialog box telling you to update the task but now instead of that. it uses the input to handle both. lastly, the multi-select feature has the button stay there in the first iteration but now only appears when you select something to delete.
